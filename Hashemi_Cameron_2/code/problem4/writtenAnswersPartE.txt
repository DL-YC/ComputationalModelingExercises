Part E
------

Under such values (t=1.0,a=.5,b=2.5), a squirrel is more similar to a rhino than
a rhino is to a squirrel. This is because our high beta value highly emphasizes
traits that B has and A doesn't. Since rhinos have more unique traits with respect to
squirrels than squirrels have with respect to rhinos, a rhino is more different
to a squirrel than a squirrel is to a rhino. This means that a squirrel is likely
closer to the prototype than a rhino - it has more common features.

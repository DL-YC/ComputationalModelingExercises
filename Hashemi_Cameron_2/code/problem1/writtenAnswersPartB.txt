Gold's theorem defines learning a language to mean that one will have no errors
in selecting that particular language as the one that's presented and no others.
In order for one to have learned the language, there must be no errors in the selection
process after a certain point. PAC doesn't hold this strict definition of learning to be
indicative of learning. It assumes that one can say she has learned a language when
the probability of error is less than a certain threshold. This is much more similar to how
languages are learned in real life. I'm sure that among English speakers, even the most grammatical
there are disputes as to what is grammatical or not, yet we all have learned English well enough,
since the probability of error is lower than the amount needed to communicate.

Knowing that the grass is wet increases the probability that the sprinklers were on,
while hearing that it rained decreases the probability. Production systems
use deductive logic - i.e. if this, then that. Bayesian systems use inductive logic
because we don't always know whether something or not has happened, but we can
estimate a likelihood, and base our decision off of that. Additionally, we have
interactions between variables under these inductive circumstances. This gives us
a striking advantage over production systems, when using Bayesian systems.

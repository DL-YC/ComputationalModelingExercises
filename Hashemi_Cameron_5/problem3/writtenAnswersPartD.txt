Problem Set 5, Question 3, Part D

I should take this coin to my father. Both the posterior mean estimate and
maximum aposteriori estimate fall around 57%. This means that given the data,
57% is the most likely hypothesis AND that given the hypothesis, the data is
most likely to have shown up. The question is whether these two estimates are
more reliable than the first mean likelihood estimate, and the answer is yes.
The mean likelihood estimate doesn't take into account our prior knowledge about
Azeroth coins - they are slightly more likely to flip heads than tails. This
fact balances our actual data, which tells us that the coin is far more likely
to flip heads than tails.

Not only is the most likely estimate for theta 57%,
but the mean of all estimates is 57%. This is strong evidence to give my
father the coin.

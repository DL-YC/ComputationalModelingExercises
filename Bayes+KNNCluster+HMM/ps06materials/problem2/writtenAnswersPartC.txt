Suggest how the results from the MSE on the test set could be
explained in terms of the bias and variance of the learning algorithms
that result from using different priors over functions.

The variance is very high for low beta values - there are many ways that the
learning algorithm can choose to fit the data. For this reason, there is a 
very high MSE. As the beta value increases, we see the mean squared error decrease
as there comes to be a balance between bias and variance. Then, further increasing
the beta value, the estimated function becomes more simple and straightforward (biased).
For this reason, underfitting the data occurs and we see the MSE increase.

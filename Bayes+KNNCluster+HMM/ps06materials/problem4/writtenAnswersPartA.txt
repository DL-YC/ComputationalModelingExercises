SENTENCES FROM YOUR HMM MODEL:

SENTENCE 1 = 'reddit'    'love'    'marbled'    'reddit'    'parks'

SENTENCE 2 = 'exhausted'    'parks'    'love'    'big'    'exhausted'

SENTENCE 3 = 'marbled'    'marbled'    'sally'    'parks'    'marbled'

WRITTEN RESPONSE:

The HMM is doing a pretty bad job of modeling the english language based
on the subset we've given it. While I can see that it's getting close to
what one might understand, the constaints we've given on the langauge are
too much. There are too few words to choose from, giving skewed probability
towards words which are of multiple parts of speech. Anytime the same word
is used twice in a sentence, there is some confusion, and since we only
have ten words (plus given a state there are even less words to choose from),
there are a lot of sentences that are confusing.

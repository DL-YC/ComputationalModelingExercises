The prototype model says that stimulus 1 is 0.99% likely to be a member of Category A than Category B.
The prototype model says that stimulus 2 is 0.99% likely to be a member of Category A than Category B.
The prototype model says that stimulus 3 is 0.99% likely to be a member of Category A than Category B.
The prototype model says that stimulus 4 is 99.01% likely to be a member of Category A than Category B.
The prototype model says that stimulus 5 is 99.01% likely to be a member of Category A than Category B.
The prototype model says that stimulus 6 is 99.01% likely to be a member of Category A than Category B.

The categorization is completely in-line with the actual categories of the exemplars.

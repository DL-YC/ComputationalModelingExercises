Hierarchical clustering:

1) Animal similarities, as to replicate the work of taxonomists. Evolution
follows a hierarchical, dendridic structure.
2) VC firm investments, as to see similarities between investor decisions,
as well as firms that either span across markets or are more niche firms.

Spatial mapping:

1) Sensory ratings - it would be informative to plot things on certain sensory scales
in order to get a feel for how smells relate to taste, for example.
2) Song similarity - there are many factors that may play into the similarity of songs,
and the continuitity of differences between songs may show interesting interplay between
spatial groups (for example, the influence of the blues on pop music, or classical music
on metal rock).

The only discrepancies between the true clusters and the predicted clusters
are on the edge cases, i.e. the points that are almost equidistant from one
cluster and another. There are a variety of reasons why this could happen.
For example, if a center randomly starts close to one of these edge cases,
that edge case could influence the location of that center such that it remains
a part of that cluster over another.

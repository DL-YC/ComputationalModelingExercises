The labeling of the object is not necessarily what I would expect, but I'm
not surprised by its classification. The algorithm classified the puppy
as a cat. Indeed, the point was an edge case. There are two other edge cases
which are misclassified by the algorithm. I think that if one of these points
were classified correctly, perhaps by choosing different starting points,
the dog would have been classified correctly. These incorrect cases sway the
centers in the wrong direction, in both directions. An incorrect case will
pull the wrong center closer and the correct center further. Edge cases seem
tricky with this form of clustering, but perhaps higher dimensions of observations
would add information and make the distinction more clear.

Explain the effect of varying beta (i.e. what functions are favored by
the prior with different values of beta?).

As Beta decreases from 1 to .001, the function favors lower-polynomial functions.
At 1, the function has sharp edges from -1 to 1, and at .001, the function seems like it's a straight line.
But after looking at the theta values, I can see that at high Betas there is a much higher coefficient
for higher polynomials, and at low Betas the higher coefficients are 0.
It seems that as beta gets smaller, the probability that high-degree thetas is very small gets
very very high. This is due to the nature of the exponential decay.

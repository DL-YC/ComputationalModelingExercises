Explain the effect of varying beta (i.e. what functions are favored by
the prior with different values of beta?).

As beta decreases from 1, the MSE decreases drastically. This is because of
overfitting the noise in high-degree polynomials (all are 7th degree polynomials,
but most coefficients for high-degree polynomials are 0 for low beta values).
The sweet spot seems to be around Beta == .3, and from there the MSE increaes
a bit. The MSE for the training and test data follow the exact same trend,
though the test data MSE is higher, which is expected.

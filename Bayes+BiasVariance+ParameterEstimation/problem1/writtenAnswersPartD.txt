As the number of heads increases, the posterior probability of a biased coin,
given the number of heads, increases rapidly and levels off around 10 heads.
This is because the model is getting more and more evidence that supports its hypothesis,
including all of the heads and especially given none of the tails.

As this sequence of heads becomes more pronounced, the likelihood probability of h1
increases while the likelihood probability of h0 decreases, bringing the posterior
probability closer and closer to 1.

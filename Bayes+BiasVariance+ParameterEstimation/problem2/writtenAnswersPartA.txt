I think the 3th degree polynomial best captures the data. It isn't as biased
by the training data as the higher degree polynomials, allowing for some variance.
The 4th degree polynomial is another good candidate for me, but 
I'm assuming that the output increases as the input increases, and the downward
tail of the 4th degree polynomial suggests some periodicity in the function,
via a decrease in the output as the input increases. If there was more data,
I might choose the 4th degree instead, but I think the best polynomial
is one that fits the data with some variance allowed, because I know there
has been noise introduced to the original function. Without this noise,
I would choose a higher degree polynomial, perhaps 6 or 7.

The MSE for both the training and test data decreases drastically from degree
0 to degree 2. From there, the MSE for the training set decreases as the degree
approaches 8. The MSE for the test data, however, increases as the degree approaches
8. We shouldn't always use a learning algorithm that gives the best results on
the training set, because this may be overfitted to the training data. Algorithms
that provide a bit more variance may encapsulate novel stimuli because of noise or
unforseen factors.

% Problem 1 (D)
%
% Interpret these results in terms of the noises the animal might make. How does the kind % of solution the neural network produces differ from the kind of thing we might expect from an account based on rules and symbols?

Animal X2 seems to be more like a cat than a dog, because it growls and hisses but doesn't bark. It definitely doesn't neigh,
which is to be reasoned from the inputs regarding dogs and cats.

Animal X5 is ambiguous. While it definitely doesn't neigh, we don't know at all
whether or not it hisses or barks, but we do know that it growls. This is to be
expected from the input being 50% dog and 50% cat.

Animal X8 is more dog than cat, barking and growling but not hissing or neighing.

All of these interpretations match the input data received and the expected
output given the percentage of dog and cat the input provided. This is better than
a pure symbols approach, because we have probabilistic outputs rather than a definite
yes/no. This way, ambiguity in inputs can be revealed in the outputs, rather than
an abstraction of yes/no that makes it seem like the decision was obvious.
Probability reveals the amount of information we have and its ability to inform
our decisions.

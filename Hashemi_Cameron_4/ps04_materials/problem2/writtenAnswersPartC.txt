% Problem 2 (C)
%
% Was the single-layer perceptron able to learn the XOR function? Explain why or why not. %How does this compare to the behavior of the perceptron used to learn the OR function?

The single layer perceptron was not able to learn the XOR function because there isn't a straight-line decision boundary that can account
for the correct outputs.

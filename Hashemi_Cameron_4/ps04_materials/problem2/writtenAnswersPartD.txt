% Problem 2 (D)
%
% Was the multi-layer perceptron able to learn the XOR function? Explain why or why not. 
% How does this compare to the behavior of the single-layer perceptron on the same input data?

The multi-layer perceptron was able to learn the XOR function by prefacing the linear classification
with a nonlinear classification. The first layer transforms the space so that the correct outputs
can be distinguished from the incorrect ones.

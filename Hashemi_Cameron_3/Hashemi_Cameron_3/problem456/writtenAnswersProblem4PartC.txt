The prototype model says that exemplar 1 is 99.01% likely to be a member of Category A than Category B.
Exemplar 2 == Category 2 w/ 98.07% probability
Exemplar 3 == Category 2 w/ 98.07% probability
Exemplar 4 == Category 1 w/ 98.07% probability
Exemplar 5 == Category 1 w/ 98.07% probability
Exemplar 6 == Category 1 w/ 98.07% probability

The categorization result was identical to the actual categories of the exemplars.

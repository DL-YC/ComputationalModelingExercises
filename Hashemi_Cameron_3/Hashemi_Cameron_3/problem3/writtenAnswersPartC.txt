There is certainly a difference in how spatial vs hierarchical representations
lend themselves to our understanding of psychological distance. Since cities
are literally distanced physically and because we understand this physical distance
via 2 dimensional maps, a spatial representation lends itself perfectly
to understanding the distances between cities. Kinships, on the other hand, do 
not have the same smooth transfer between psychological distance and spatial plotting.
Instead, their similarities psychologically exist in hierarchical clusters (nuclear family, extended family,
parental hierarchy), so seeing a dendrogram confirms our intuitions about their
relationships (e.g. ancestry trees are graphed in a dendrogram). Interestingly enough,
we are able to see a male/female divide between kinship terms. Since this information
is not given in the dendrogram, there is a case to be made for the informativeness
of multiple representations. The fact that gender information can be derived from
simple similarity ratings is remarkable.

The plot mostly reflects my intuitions about the relationship between terms
in the similarity matrix.

It's clear that males and females are separated by the y axis and that
parental vs. other relative relationships are separated by the x axis (parents in the negative
space and relatives - uncles, aunts, and their children - in the positive
space). So, although mother and father have substantial distance in the x-axis,
they are close in the y-axis, reflecting their similarity ratings and my
intuition about their kinship relationship.

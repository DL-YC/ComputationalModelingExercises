Part C
------

Given a larger hypothesis space, I required more trials n in order to win the game.
This is predicted by the PAC theorem. As my hypothesis space gets bigger, my probability
of error increases (as seen by my increased mistakes with a larger hypothesis space),
and the number of trials needed to get the answer increases.

Part E
------

Unfortunately, I will not always be able to win this game. Since the possible
languages contains an infinite set of sentences amongst every subset of that infinite set,
I can never know whether my current language (based on observations) is complete or not.
That is: my current language can always satisfy the infinite set; but since it would take
an infinite amount of time to know whether my set is the infinite set, there will never be a point
that I can postulate that my language is the infinite set (the question is: can I ever know
if anything is infinite? or do I just imagine that things are?).
The possibility of an infinite language, in combination with an infinitude of languages, leaves me
in the dark as to when I can know for certain what my language is.

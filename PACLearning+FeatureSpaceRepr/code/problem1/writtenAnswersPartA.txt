Part A
------

In proving his theorem, Gold assumes that people face adverserial learning
and that they only see positive examples. The first assumption seems counter to how
language is actually learned - we often communicate to cooperate and mutually benefit
each other rather than oppose and trick each other. The second assumption is more accurate,
as evidenced by experimental data - people are corrected on their grammar much less than not.
Even still, when "strictly learning" a language (past elementary school), people are often corrected on their
mistakes. This correcting is what allows them to "learn" the language. These differences between assumptions and
reality depend upon the definition of learning a grammar.

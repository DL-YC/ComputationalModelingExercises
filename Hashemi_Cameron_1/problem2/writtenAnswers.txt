Part A
------

The implementation level meant to answer "physically, what is it?", the algorithmic
level meant to answer "how does it work?", and the computaitonal level
meant to answer "what is it meant for?".


Part B
------

Implementation: a cash register can be physically implemented in a number of ways,
but it needs buttons to input cash in and a calculator to compute change out, a storage bin to
hold the cash, and some sort of output mechanism to show the cashier and customer the calculations
(to verify correctness)

Algorithmic: a cash register begins operation when the cashier enter in the price of something purchased
by the customer. The customer is made aware of this amount, and pays the cashier at least the said amount.
The cashier, via some mechanism dependent on the cash register mechanics, opens the cash storage bin and places
the cash given by the customer in the storage bin. The cashier then inputs this amount into the cash register,
and the cash register subtracts the amount charged from the amount paid. If the difference is greater than 0, the
cash register displays the amount of "change" to be given back to the customer. This amount is retrieved from the storage bin
and given to the customer.

Computational: a cash register facilitates transactions between a business and its customers by providing a storage
location for cash and calculating the total amount of purchases, in addition to the amount of change owed to the customer
when applicable.

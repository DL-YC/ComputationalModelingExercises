Problem Set 1, Problem 3
========================

Part A
------

If I know that the switch is flipped, I know that the sprinkler was on.
If I know that the springler was on, I know that the grass is wet.
Since I don't know if it rained or not, I don't know whether the car or path are wet.


Part B
------

If I know that the path is slippery, I know that it rained.
I don't know if the switch is flipped because I don't know if the sprinkler was on.


Part C
------

If I know that the path slippery, I know that it rained.
If I know that it rained, I know that the car and grass are wet.
I don't know if the sprinkler was on or if the switch is flipped.

If I know that the sprinkler was on, I know that the switch was flipped and that the grass is wet.
I don't know if the path is slippery, the car is wet, or if it rained.

These sets of conclusions seem correct, though they are missing some knowledge.
It we know both whether or not it rained and whether or not the switch is flipped, we can know all the
pertinent information. The limitations of production systems is that not all information is always available,
so some decisions that might be necessary may never be made until this information comes available.

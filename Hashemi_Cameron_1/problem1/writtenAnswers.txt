hippo = quadrapedal & strainteeth & hairless


Part H

I can't think of an animal that is not a hippo and meets this definition
(I'm not well-versed in zoology), but any hippo that does not live in a jungle would
not meet this definition. Of course, hippos are still hippos regardless of their location.
This is a problem for logical definitions, because unless we know about every single hippo and
every single non hippo, it's impossible for us to know whether or not there is a hippo or non-hippo
that is anomalous to our definition.

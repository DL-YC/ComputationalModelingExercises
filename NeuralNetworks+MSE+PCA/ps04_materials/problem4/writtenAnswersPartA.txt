It seems that all three datasets are plotted in three dimensions; however,
plot A only varies in 1 dimension and plot B only varies 2 dimensions.

Plot C is tricky, because while it clearly varies in 3 dimensions, the data
forms a distinct and clean spiral shape. The lack of variation from this shape 
tells us that we can actually represent the data in 2 dimensions, but I don't
think that it's safe to say that the data "actually varies" in 2 dimensions,
even though it can be described in 2 dimensions.

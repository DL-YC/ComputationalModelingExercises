Problem Set 4, Question 4, Part C

Dataset A is plotted in two dimensions, though it only runs along one dimension.
In the code, it's seen that PCA reduced A to only one dimension, and the representation
of it on the plot looks exactly like it did in the original, so PCA worked by
making the data less complex (3 dimensions down to 1).

Dataset B is plotted in two dimensions, and the relationships between the points
are exactly the same as they were in the original plot (source: eyes), so it seems
that PCA worked for dataset B. One would not lose much information about the data
as a whole by viewing it after PCA.

Dataset C is plotted in two dimensions, but it seems that some information has been lost.
The data looks as it does from a birds-eye view of the original, meaning the variation
in the points along the "height" axis was virtually eliminated. Someone looking at the
plot under PCA would lose an important aspect of the original data - the spiral-shape
pattern.

The red and green lines represent the principal components of each dataset, or
the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix for each dataset. These vectors, when
used to perform a change of bases on the data, account for the most variance
within the data, i.e. when we map the data with those two lines standing as
axes, we have reduced the data into a simpler representation (less dimensions).

The red line represents the first principal component that accounts for the
most variance, i.e. having the highest eigenvalue amongst eigenvectors of the
covariance matrix. The green line represents the second principal component that
accounts for the most second variance possible, but it completely independent
of the variance accounted for in the first component. This independence is
known as orthagonality, and it is the result of the eigenvectors being derived
from the symmetrical covariance matrix.

Problem Set 4, Question 3, Part F

The network has not learned the anbn grammar. Playing around with the layers
of the network doesn't seem to help with this problem either. Due to this discrepancy,
we can say that neural networks such as Elman's cannot learn context-free grammars.
It seems unable to relate the streaks of As and Bs, most likely because of the overwhelming 
evidence that As come after As and Bs come after Bs. Perhaps lowering the ceiling for N
will result in less error on switches. However, this may lead to more error overall,
due to the higher frequency of words.
